# auto-framework
This is a Selenium Automation framework just in case I need to use one quick and I don't want to be setting up all from scratch.

## Technologies 👾
- Java
- Selenium
- MSEdge Web Driver
- TestNG
- Extent Reports

## Installing this framework 💾
- Clone the project
- Install your preferred JDK (17 or above)
- Under System Variable, create a new variable named "CLASSPATH" with route to the JDK binary. Example: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin"
- Under System Variables, edit "Path" and add a New one. Example: "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-17\bin"
- Take into account this specific framework is only currently configured for MS Edge Browser so you might have to download and copy the latest `msedgedriver.exe` into the corresponding src/main/resources folder.

## Running Tests 🏃
- Here you have two options
- _Running with Maven:_ Download maven from the apache website. After you install it add adding the `bin` directory with the `mvn` command to the `PATH`. Then from the CMD ot Eclipse terminal run the following command "mvn clean test"
- _Running with Eclipse:_ Download Eclipse and TestNG plugin. Right click on the testng.xml and select "Run with TestNG".
- You will see the reports in /target/results directory.
 
## Github Actions ✔️
- This project is set up for being run on Github Actions. Everytime there is a Pull Request or a Push to the main branch an Action will be run and test will be executed. The report along with the results can be found in the Artifacts inside the run.
- For more information about how is Github Actions configured, check the folder ".github/worlkflows" and the file `maven.yml`

## Additional Notes 🗒️
- I have tried to use _BoniGarcia WebDriverManager_ to auto-download the correct detected Web Driver. I tested thoroughly a full day using Edge Version 116 and found that it was downloading an incorrect driver version. In conclusion I will avoid depending on a 3rd party library which is maintained by only one person.
